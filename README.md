## Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenge** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The challenge was to recreate a dynamic showcase. Where you can use the Drag/Drop function to add the articles to the shopping car and allways show the final price of the buy. 

The design of the showcase and its products is freely so I decide to use CSS, for all the styles, except the article SVG. I use a free use SVG collection linked bellow.
*SVG*: https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/food-and-drinks-flat-icons-2/

### **Extra challenge**
The¬¥re was an extra challenge to implement a functionality to be able remove them from the cart. 

I decide that the easiest way to do this was by adding a button to the articles that only was able in the shopping list.

# ‚úÖ **Functioning** ‚úÖ
The operation is simple. Just drag the articles you want from the articles container to the shopping car. This articles have a functionality to add the amount of articles added to the shopping car that will be reflected in the final price.

In case you want to remove the article, you can do it by using the red button that appear when the article is in the shopping car.
